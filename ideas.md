# Ideas

* a name generator based on parsing text with spacey and subtracting words from a list of common words
* Static site generators each meniacally focused on a single simple common type of site
  * a blog (like https://vitalik.ca/, or https://blog.jessfraz.com/)
  * a product one pager/executive summary
  * documentation (just use sphynx? docusaurous?)
* Some tool to help keep permalinks permanent
